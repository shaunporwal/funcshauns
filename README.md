# funcshauns - My Python Functions

This package/repo is a playground in which I experiment with various technologies, python packing, function writing, optimizations, etc.

[25-03-17] - Changed my mind, UV is incredible for Python packaging now. Just use this action: `https://github.com/shaunporwal/funcshauns/blob/main/.github/workflows/uv-actions.yaml`

[24-12-29] - lesson learned, never use tools that are brand new. I tried using uv, it's the absolute worse for python packaging and publishing to pypi/test.pypi.
