# funcshauns - My Python Functions

This package/repo is a playground in which I experiment with various technologies, python packing, function writing, optimizations, etc. 

[24-12-29] - lesson learned, never use tools that are brand new. I tried using uv, it's the absolute worse for python packaging and publishing to pypi/test.pypi.
